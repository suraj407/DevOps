# DevOps_Tech_Assessment
Assessment for Senior DevOps Engineer

# Task:
 Refactor this configuration into a clean, reusable module-based structure that can 
be used across multiple environments (dev, staging, prod).
• Avoid duplication
• Make it environment-agnostic via variables
• Structure it into layers if possible (e.g., core infra, network, services, etc.)
• Bonus: show how to call this module for different environments
